# Mortality Prediction of Patients in Intensive Care
The project that is being proposed aims to utilize data collected from patients in order to predict their chances 
of survival while being treated in an intensive care unit (ICU). The data collected includes a variety of demographic information, as well as body vital signs and information about any pre-existing medical conditions that the patient may have. This data is collected at hospitals and is continuously monitored throughout the patient's stay in the ICU. By utilizing machine learning models, the goal is to be able to accurately predict the 
survival rate of patients, based on the information that has been collected.
